        <p class="main_text">
            By the early 1800s, certain observations led the English chemist John Dalton (1766-1844) to <br>
            offer convincing evidence that supported the early atomic ideas of Leucippus and Democritus. <br>
            The three most important laws that led to the development and acceptance of the atomic <br>
            theory are as follows:
        </p>

            <ul class="lists">
                <li>The law of conservation of mass.</li>
                <li>The law of definite proportions.</li>
                <li>The law of multiple proportions.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p class="main_text">
            In 1804, John Dalton published his law of multiple proportions, which claims the following principle:
        </p>

            <ul class="lists">
                <li>
                    When two elements (call them A and B) form two different compounds, the masses of element B  <br>
                    that combine with 1 g of element A can be expressed as a ratio of small whole numbers.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p class="main_text">
            In 1808, John Dalton explained the laws just discussed with his atomic theory, which included <br>
            the following concepts:
        </p>
        
            <ol class="lists">
                <li>Each element is composed of tiny indestructible particles called Atoms.</li>
                <li>
                    All atoms of a given element have the same mass and physical/chemical properties that <br>
                    distinguish them from the atoms of other elements.
                </li>
                <li>Atoms combine in simple, whole-number ratios to form compounds.</li>
                <li>
                    Atoms of one element cannot change into atoms of another element. In a chemical reaction, <br>
                    atoms only change how they are bound together with other atoms.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="main_text">
                Dalton imagined atoms as solid, hard spheres, similar to billiard (pool) balls because he believed <br> 
                they were the smallest particles of matter. He used wooden balls to simulate them. He also suggested <br>
                that atoms can rearrange themselves to form new substances in chemical reactions; however, atoms can <br>
                never be created or destroyed. Dalton also suggested the use of symbols for atoms of different elements.
