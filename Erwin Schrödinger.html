            In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger calculated the probability of detecting an electron in a specific <br>
            position using mathematical formulas. This quantum mechanical model does not define an <br>
            electron by the path it takes to orbit the nucleus; instead, it predicts the probability <br>
            of the electron being in any given place. A nucleus surrounded by an electron cloud can be <br>
            characterized as this model. The possibility of discovering an electron is higher in the <br>
            cloud's denser parts. In contrast, identifying an electron is more difficult in the cloud's <br>
            less dense regions.

            Erwin also created the Electron Cloud Model. This quantum mechanical model does not define <br>
            an electron by its path to orbit the nucleus; rather, it predicts the probability of the <br>
            electron being in any given place. A nucleus surrounded by an electron cloud can be characterized <br>
            as this model. The possibility of discovering an electron is higher in the cloud's denser parts. <br>
            In contrast, identifying an electron is more difficult in the cloud's less dense parts.
