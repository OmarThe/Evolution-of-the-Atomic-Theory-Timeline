        <p class="main_text">
            Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) discovered that there were three different kinds of emissions:
        </p>

        <ul class="lists">
            <li>Alpha (α) particles with a mass 4x that of the H atom and a positive (+) charge.</li>
            <li>Beta (β) particles with a mass ~1/2000x that of the H atom and a negative (–) charge.</li>
            <li>Gamma (γ) rays that are energy rays, not particles.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="main_text">
            In 1909, Ernest Rutherford, who had worked under Thomson and subscribed to his plum-pudding model, <br>
            experimented in an attempt to confirm it. His experiment, which employed (alpha) particles, <br>
            proved it wrong instead. In the experiment, Rutherford directed the positively charged (alpha) <br>
            particles at an ultrathin sheet of gold foil. <br>
        </p>

        <p class="main_text">
            These particles were to act as probes of the gold atoms' structure. If the gold atoms were like <br>
            blueberry muffins or plum pudding-with, with their mass and charge spread throughout the entire volume <br>
            of the atom, these speeding probes should pass right through the gold foil with minimum deflection. <br>
        </p>

        <p class="main_text">
            Rutherford performed the experiment, but the results were not as he expected. A majority of the <br>
            particles did pass directly through the foil, but some particles were deflected, and some <br>
            (approximately 1 in 20000) even bounced back. The results puzzled Rutherford, who wrote that they were <br>
            "about as credible as if you had fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it <br>
            came back and hit you."

        <p class="main_text">
            To explain his results, Rutherford created a new model, a modern version, called the Rutherford Model.<br> 
            He concluded that matter must not be as uniform as it appears in contrast to the plum-pudding model. <br>
            It must contain large regions of empty space dotted with small areas of very dense matter.
        </p>

        <p class="main_text">
            Building on this idea, he proposed the nuclear theory of the atom, with two essential parts:
        </p>

        <ol class="lists">
            <li>
                Most of the atom's mass and all its positive charges are contained in a small core called the nucleus.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most of the atom's volume is empty space, throughout which tiny, negatively charged electrons are dispersed.
            </li>
        </ol>
