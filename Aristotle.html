            Around 350 B.C.E., Aristotle (384-322 B.C.E.), an influential Greek thinker at the time, <br>
            disagreed with Democritus' atomic concepts. Instead, they believed that matter was made up of <br>
            varying amounts of fire, air, earth, and water and that there were no smallest parts to matter. <br>
            Because there was no method to assess the relative merits of opposing concepts in an <br>
            experimental setting, Aristotle's viewpoint won over, owing to his influence. For approximately <br>
            2000 years, the idea that matter is made up of atoms took a back place in intellectual thought.
