                    Around 400 B.C.E., Democritus (460-370 B.C.E.) and his mentor Leucippus were the first to propose <br>
                    that matter was made up of minute, indestructible particles. The Greek philosopher Aristotle <br>
                    argued that matter is made up of microscopic, indivisible components known as "atomos." <br>
                    "Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion.", Democritus wrote. <br>
                    Democritus suggested that there were many various types of atoms, each with its own shape and size, <br>
                    that travelled randomly through space.
