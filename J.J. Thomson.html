            The Discovery of the Electron
        </h2>

        <p class="main_text">
            J. J. Thomson (1856-1940), an English physicist working at Cambridge University in 1897, conducted experiments to <br>
            investigate the properties of cathode rays. Thomson created a cathode ray tube, which is a glass tube. The tube had been <br>
            partially evacuated, which meant that some of the air had been forced out (because air interferes with cathode rays). <br>
            Thomson then used two electrodes at either end of the tube to provide a high electrical voltage. Thomson discovered that <br>
            cathode rays pass from a negatively charged electrode (the cathode) to a positively charged electrode (the anode). 
        </p>

        <p class="main_text">
            Thomson found that these particles had the following properties:
        </p>

        <ul class="lists">
            <li>They travelled in straight lines.</li>
            <li>They were independent of the composition of the material from which they originated (the cathode).</li>
            <li>They carried a negative electrical charge.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="main_text">
            J. J. Thomson used electric and magnetic fields to deflect cathode ray particles and quantify their charge-to-mass ratio. <br>
            The cathode ray particle was around 2000 times lighter (less massive) than hydrogen, the lightest known atom, based on <br>
            the value he measured, 1.76 X 10^8 coulombs (C) per gram. These findings were astoundingâ€”it appeared that the indestructible <br>
            atom could apparently be chipped! J. J. Thomson had discovered the electron.

            J. J. Thomson proposed that the negatively charged electrons were small particles held within a positively charged <br>
            sphere. The most popular model of the time became known as the plum-pudding model.
