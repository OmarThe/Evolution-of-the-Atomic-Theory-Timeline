            With the following equation, Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) formalized the inability <br>
            to perceive the electron simultaneously as a particle and a wave:

            In 1927, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle stated that the more accurately you know the <br>
            position of an electron, the less accurately you can understand its velocity and vice versa. <br>
            The complementarity of the electron's wave nature and particle nature results in the <br>
            complementarity of velocity and position. This principle is only applicable at the atomic <br>
            level. To locate an electron inside an atom, a specialized microscope would be used to observe <br>
            its interaction with photons of light. Because a photon and an electron have comparable energy <br>
            levels, any attempt to locate an electron by interacting with a photon would result in the <br>
            electron being thrown off course of its orbit.
