            Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907), a Russian chemistry professor, saw a pattern in the properties <br>
            of elements. In 1869, Mendeleev's insight led to the periodic table, arguably the single most <br>
            crucial tool for the chemist. Dmitri created the periodic table by arranging the chemical <br>
            elements of his day in order of their atomic weights. He made new lines and categorized them <br>
            according to known behaviour patterns, allowing him to forecast the existence of three elements. <br>
            Using his periodic table's architecture, Mendeleev anticipated the properties of gallium, scandium, <br>
            and germanium. Let's think of Mendeleev's periodic table as a compact way to summarize many observations.
