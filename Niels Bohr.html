            In 1912, while working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Manchester alongside Ernest <br>
            Rutherford, Niels Bohr made his first contribution to quantum physics. Rutherford had discovered the <br>
            atom consisted of a hefty positively charged nucleus with light, negatively charged electrons circling <br>
            it at a distance the year before. Bohr realized this arrangement wouldn't be stable based on his prior <br>
            knowledge. In three papers published in 1913 in The Philosophical Magazine, Bohr claimed that electrons <br>
            could only inhabit specific orbits given by the quantum of action and that electromagnetic radiation <br>
            from an atom happened only when an electron hopped to a lower-energy rotation. Even though most scientists<br>
            at the time did not believe Bohr's atomic model, Bohr was able to explain a large quantity of experimental<br>
            evidence, beginning with the spectral line series emitted by hydrogen.

            In 1913, Niels Bohr (1885-1962), a Danish scientist, attempted to build an atomic model that <br>
            described atomic spectra (a spectrum of radiation due to electron transitions within atoms) <br>
            consisting mainly of a series of spectrum lines characteristic of the element). In his idea, <br>
            electrons travel in circular orbits around the nucleus, similar to how planets orbit the sun. <br>
            On the other hand, Bohr's orbits could only exist at specified defined distances from the nucleus, <br>
            unlike planetary orbits, which can theoretically exist at any distance from the sun. Each Bohr <br>
            orbit's energy was fixed or quantized. These orbits were dubbed "stationary states" by Bohr, <br>
            who claimed that while they obeyed classical mechanics, they also contained "a peculiar, mechanically <br>
            unexplainable, stability." In contrast to traditional electromagnetic theory, Bohr also hypothesized <br>
            that an electron orbiting the nucleus in a stationary condition emits no radiation. Radiation was <br>
            only emitted or absorbed when an electron leapt or moved from one stationary state to another.

            Although most physicists at the time didn't accept the Bohr atomic model, Bohr was able to account <br>
            for a considerable amount of experimental data starting with the spectral line series emitted by <br>
            hydrogen.
