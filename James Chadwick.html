            British scientist James Chadwick (1891-1974), Rutherford's student, demonstrated that <br>
            the previously unaccounted mass was due to neutrons, neutral particles in the nucleus. <br>
            The mass of a neutron is similar to that of a proton, but a neutron has no electrical <br>
            charge. In 1932, James Chadwick proposed:

            He conducted an experiment where he shot alpha particles at Beryllium. The results show <br>
            high amounts of radiation that went through the Beryllium shield. The discovered particles <br>
            could not explain these results at the time. Chadwick was not convinced that these alpha <br>
            particles combined with only protons (at the time) could produce such a powerful energy <br>
            source. He figured out that there were particles without charge but that had a mass similar <br>
            to that of a proton.
