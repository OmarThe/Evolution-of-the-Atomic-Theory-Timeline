            In 1952, Murray Gell-Mann discovered a new class of elementary particles known as cosmic <br>
            ray particles (now called kaons and hyperons). After discovering these particles, Einstein <br>
            proposed quantum chromodynamics, a theory that describes the strong force's behaviour. <br>
            Quantum chromodynamics was developed in the same way that quantum electrodynamics, or the <br>
            quantum field theory of electromagnetic force, was created. According to this idea, subatomic <br>
            particles like electrons, protons, and neutrons are built up of "quarks."

            George Zweig was the first to notice mathematical constructions that explained regularities <br>
            in early particle-scattering tests' results. This was crucial in his quest for quarks. In <br>
            1964, George Zweig was the first to introduce quarks, which laid the groundwork for particle <br>
            physics. Like Murray Gell- Mann's, particles' realized features could be explained by treating <br>
            them as triplets of other constituent particles.
